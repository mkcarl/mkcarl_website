                <p id="about-me">Hi there! As you might be able to tell, my name is Carl, and the picture to the right is me. I am from Malaysia, currently still a student studying in Asia Pacific University. My major is Computer Science with specialism in Intelligent Systems. I am passionate about math, sciences and also technology! For me, the advancements in the AI field really is taking a huge step, and I do think that AI would be the future of the world as it is already slowly integrating into ourlives, whether we realise it or not. I also hope to contribute to the field of Computer Science as much as possible by taking small steps like learning new technology everyday, and eventually I will be able to follow the footsteps of Alan Turing, John Von Neumann and other fathers of Computer Science.</p>

                    <p>I am fluent with the Python programming language. After learning the fundamentals, I have also dived into advanced topics like working with libraries. Example is Pandas, matplotlib, pygames, BeautifulSoup, tkinter, discord.py, and so on.</p>

                    <p>I have learned the basics of HTML. This whole website is self-written HTML with proper semantics. However, I have not explored deeper into HTML and I would not say I am expert in this section. I did however, tried all the examples listed in the tutorial of freecodecamp.org </p>

                    <p>I have learned basic CSS in order to style this website. I have not dived deep into CSS like using external frameworks like bootstrap as I am still exploring the basics. For me, CSS is quite challanging as I am not good in creative designs. However, I am able to bring out what I imagined for this webpage with pure CSS.</p>

                    <p>I have successfully written a bot for my discord server. I deployed the bot with Heroku and Google Cloud Platform. The bot is capable of replying messages, add reactions and perform certain functions like autodelete messages. I plan to further develop the bot and cover more features in order to provide quality of life features to my friends and I in the server.</p>
